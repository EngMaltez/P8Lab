% circle protect game

You control a circle in the middle of the screen.
Circle can produce shockwaves.
Rocks (brown circles) are coming the the circle's direction.
Shockwaves contain a certain energy that damages the rocks.
As the wave speads energy becomes less concentrated, thus dealing less damage.
Damage to a rock is proportional to rock perimeter and shockwave hit arc.

=====

* make big rocks fracture into small rocks
  - make shards also do damage
  - make shards fly in random directions
* player movement
  - make player expend energy from the bar to move
  - have player keep momentum
  - maybe just expend energy to change momentum
  - animate thusters
  - collision box will be a circle
